Hosted: https://yogabackend.azurewebsites.net/
Bit of a lazy site, since it's free

Running it locally:
Create a new .env file in root dir with the variables
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER={user}
MYSQL_PASSWORD={password}
MYSQL_DATABASE=yogadb
MYSQL_PORT=3000

and fill in the {} with ur local db credentials
The db can be created by running the yogaDB.sql file

then run: tsc 
after: npm start

Congrats! ur backend should now be hosted on http://localhost:3000
